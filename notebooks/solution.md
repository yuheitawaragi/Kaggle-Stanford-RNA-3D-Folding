## ðŸ¥‰Kaggle Stanford RNA 3D Folding Bronze (My Solution)

# Overview and goal

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "Stanford RNA 3D Folding".
The task is to predict the 3D structure of RNA molecules using only their nucleotide sequences.
Participants will build machine learning models that learn how RNA sequences fold into specific 3D conformations.
Accurate predictions will deepen our understanding of RNAâ€™s role in biology and contribute to advances in medicine and biotechnology.

# Approach

In this project, we predict RNA 3D structures from RNA sequences using an ensemble of DRfold2 and Protenix models.

###1 Preparation for DRfold2

###2 Preparation for Protenix

###3 Prediction using an ensemble of DRfold2 and Protenix

This script performs RNA 3D structure prediction using an ensemble of DRfold2 and Protenix.

* If the RNA sequence length is â‰¤ 480, 3 structures are generated by DRfold2 and 2 by Protenix, forming 5 predictions.
* If the sequence length is > 480, all 5 structures are generated by Protenix.
* For each sequence, the predicted coordinates of the C1â€² atom are saved into a submission.csv file in the required format.
